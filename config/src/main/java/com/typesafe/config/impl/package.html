Please check out the {@link com.typesafe.config.Config public API} instead, unless
you're interested in browsing implementation details. None of the ABI
under <code>impl</code> has any guarantees; it will change whenever someone
feels like changing it. If you feel you need access to something
in <code>impl</code>, <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/issues">please
file a feature request</a>.
