/**
 * An immutable map from config paths to config values. Paths are dot-separated
 * expressions such as <code>foo.bar.baz</code>. Values are as in JSON
 * (booleans, strings, numbers, lists, or objects), represented by
 * {@link ConfigValue} instances. Values accessed through the
 * <code>Config</code> interface are never null.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code Config} is an immutable object and thus safe to use from multiple
 * threads. There's never a need for "defensive copies."
 * 
 * <p>
 * Fundamental operations on a {@code Config} include getting configuration
 * values, <em>resolving</em> substitutions with {@link Config#resolve()}, and
 * merging configs using {@link Config#withFallback(ConfigMergeable)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All operations return a new immutable {@code Config} rather than modifying
 * the original instance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Examples</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can find an example app and library <a
 * href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples">on
 * GitHub</a>. Also be sure to read the <a
 * href="package-summary.html#package_description">package overview</a> which
 * describes the big picture as shown in those examples.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Paths, keys, and Config vs. ConfigObject</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>Config</code> is a view onto a tree of {@link ConfigObject}; the
 * corresponding object tree can be found through {@link Config#root()}.
 * <code>ConfigObject</code> is a map from config <em>keys</em>, rather than
 * paths, to config values. Think of <code>ConfigObject</code> as a JSON object
 * and <code>Config</code> as a configuration API.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The API tries to consistently use the terms "key" and "path." A key is a key
 * in a JSON object; it's just a string that's the key in a map. A "path" is a
 * parseable expression with a syntax and it refers to a series of keys. Path
 * expressions are described in the <a
 * href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">spec for
 * Human-Optimized Config Object Notation</a>. In brief, a path is
 * period-separated so "a.b.c" looks for key c in object b in object a in the
 * root object. Sometimes double quotes are needed around special characters in
 * path expressions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The API for a {@code Config} is in terms of path expressions, while the API
 * for a {@code ConfigObject} is in terms of keys. Conceptually, {@code Config}
 * is a one-level map from <em>paths</em> to values, while a
 * {@code ConfigObject} is a tree of nested maps from <em>keys</em> to values.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Use {@link ConfigUtil#joinPath} and {@link ConfigUtil#splitPath} to convert
 * between path expressions and individual path elements (keys).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Another difference between {@code Config} and {@code ConfigObject} is that
 * conceptually, {@code ConfigValue}s with a {@link ConfigValue#valueType()
 * valueType()} of {@link ConfigValueType#NULL NULL} exist in a
 * {@code ConfigObject}, while a {@code Config} treats null values as if they
 * were missing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Getting configuration values</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The "getters" on a {@code Config} all work in the same way. They never return
 * null, nor do they return a {@code ConfigValue} with
 * {@link ConfigValue#valueType() valueType()} of {@link ConfigValueType#NULL
 * NULL}. Instead, they throw {@link ConfigException.Missing} if the value is
 * completely absent or set to null. If the value is set to null, a subtype of
 * {@code ConfigException.Missing} called {@link ConfigException.Null} will be
 * thrown. {@link ConfigException.WrongType} will be thrown anytime you ask for
 * a type and the value has an incompatible type. Reasonable type conversions
 * are performed for you though.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Iteration</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you want to iterate over the contents of a {@code Config}, you can get its
 * {@code ConfigObject} with {@link #root()}, and then iterate over the
 * {@code ConfigObject} (which implements <code>java.util.Map</code>). Or, you
 * can use {@link #entrySet()} which recurses the object tree for you and builds
 * up a <code>Set</code> of all path-value pairs where the value is not null.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Resolving substitutions</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>Substitutions</em> are the <code>${foo.bar}</code> syntax in config
 * files, described in the <a href=
 * "https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#substitutions"
 * >specification</a>. Resolving substitutions replaces these references with real
 * values.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before using a {@code Config} it's necessary to call {@link Config#resolve()}
 * to handle substitutions (though {@link ConfigFactory#load()} and similar
 * methods will do the resolve for you already).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Merging</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The full <code>Config</code> for your application can be constructed using
 * the associative operation {@link Config#withFallback(ConfigMergeable)}. If
 * you use {@link ConfigFactory#load()} (recommended), it merges system
 * properties over the top of <code>application.conf</code> over the top of
 * <code>reference.conf</code>, using <code>withFallback</code>. You can add in
 * additional sources of configuration in the same way (usually, custom layers
 * should go either just above or just below <code>application.conf</code>,
 * keeping <code>reference.conf</code> at the bottom and system properties at
 * the top).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Serialization</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Convert a <code>Config</code> to a JSON or HOCON string by calling
 * {@link ConfigObject#render()} on the root object,
 * <code>myConfig.root().render()</code>. There's also a variant
 * {@link ConfigObject#render(ConfigRenderOptions)} which allows you to control
 * the format of the rendered string. (See {@link ConfigRenderOptions}.) Note
 * that <code>Config</code> does not remember the formatting of the original
 * file, so if you load, modify, and re-save a config file, it will be
 * substantially reformatted.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As an alternative to {@link ConfigObject#render()}, the
 * <code>toString()</code> method produces a debug-output-oriented
 * representation (which is not valid JSON).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Java serialization is supported as well for <code>Config</code> and all
 * subtypes of <code>ConfigValue</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>This is an interface but don't implement it yourself</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>Do not implement {@code Config}</em>; it should only be implemented by
 * the config library. Arbitrary implementations will not work because the
 * library internals assume a specific concrete implementation. Also, this
 * interface is likely to grow new methods over time, so third-party
 * implementations will break.

     * <p>
     * This method uses {@link ConfigResolveOptions#defaults()}, there is

     * 
     * <p>
     * A given {@link Config} must be resolved before using it to retrieve
     * config values, but ideally should be resolved one time for your entire
     * stack of fallbacks (see {@link Config#withFallback}). Otherwise, some
     * substitutions that could have resolved with all fallbacks available may
     * not resolve, which will be potentially confusing for your application's
     * users.
     * 
     * <p>
     * <code>resolve()</code> should be invoked on root config objects, rather
     * than on a subtree (a subtree is the result of something like
     * <code>config.getConfig("foo")</code>). The problem with
     * <code>resolve()</code> on a subtree is that substitutions are relative to
     * the root of the config and the subtree will have no way to get values
     * from the root. For example, if you did
     * <code>config.getConfig("foo").resolve()</code> on the below config file,
     * it would not work:
     * 
     * <pre>
     *   common-value = 10
     *   foo {
     *      whatever = ${common-value}

     * </pre>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Many methods on {@link ConfigFactory} such as
     * {@link ConfigFactory#load()} automatically resolve the loaded
     * <code>Config</code> on the loaded stack of config files.
     * 
     * <p>
     * Resolving an already-resolved config is a harmless no-op, but again, it
     * is best to resolve an entire stack of fallbacks (such as all your config
     * files combined) rather than resolving each one individually.

     * <p>
     * Using this method is always optional, since you can "fail late" instead.
     *
     * <p>
     * You must restrict validation to paths you "own" (those whose meaning are

     * with your module. It's best to allow the modules owning those paths to

     * isn't as much redundant work being done.
     *
     * <p>
     * If no paths are specified in <code>checkValid()</code>'s parameter list,
     * validation is for the entire config.
     *
     * <p>
     * If you specify paths that are not in the reference config, those paths
     * are ignored. (There's nothing to validate.)
     *
     * <p>
     * Here's what validation involves:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>All paths found in the reference config must be present in this
     * config or an exception will be thrown.
     * <li>
     * Some changes in type from the reference config to this config will cause
     * an exception to be thrown. Not all potential type problems are detected,
     * in particular it's assumed that strings are compatible with everything
     * except objects and lists. This is because string types are often "really"
     * some other type (system properties always start out as strings, or a
     * string like "5ms" could be used with {@link #getMilliseconds}). Also,
     * it's allowed to set any type to null or override null with any type.
     * <li>
     * Any unresolved substitutions in this config will cause a validation
     * failure; both the reference config and this config should be resolved
     * before validation. If the reference config is unresolved, it's a bug in
     * the caller of this method.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * If you want to allow a certain setting to have a flexible type (or
     * otherwise want validation to be looser for some settings), you could
     * either remove the problematic setting from the reference config provided
     * to this method, or you could intercept the validation exception and
     * screen out certain problems. Of course, this will only work if all other
     * callers of this method are careful to restrict validation to their own
     * paths, as they should be.
     *
     * <p>
     * If validation fails, the thrown exception contains a list of all problems
     * found. See {@link ConfigException.ValidationFailed#problems}. The
     * exception's <code>getMessage()</code> will have all the problems
     * concatenated into one huge string, as well.
     *
     * <p>
     * Again, <code>checkValid()</code> can't guess every domain-specific way a
     * setting can be invalid, so some problems may arise later when attempting
     * to use the config. <code>checkValid()</code> is limited to reporting
     * generic, but common, problems such as missing settings and blatant type
